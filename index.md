I am a computational scientist with over 20 years of experience developing tools and workflows for Earth system modeling and analysis. Currently, I serve as Chief Scientific Programmer Analyst with Science Systems and Applications, Inc. (SSAI), supporting the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

My work focuses on the design and implementation of reproducible, scalable software systems to support climate and weather modeling, including the NASA Unified WRF (NU-WRF) framework. I am also the architect and lead developer of **eViz**, a Python-based visualization toolkit for model diagnostics and data exploration.

I have contributed to high-impact efforts across modeling, visualization, and high-performance computing, and have experience mentoring interns and junior scientists, and teaching university-level courses on scientific computing and simulation.
